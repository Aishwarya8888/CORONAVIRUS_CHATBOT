# Coronavirus Chatbot using Microsoft Azure QnA Maker service and Web App bot

This project utilizes the power of Azure Cognitive Services, QnA Maker along with Azure Bot Service to construct a Chat Bot on a website created using Google sites to provide high reliability, availablity and accurate information about Coronavirus to the user.User will be provided with a well-designed Chat Bot that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) and QnA data to provide user with most accurate answer to their query. QnA Maker can help fetch data from the knowlege base we have provided and can also apply NLP techniques to display accurate information to the user. I have used Google sites to host this bot but,many other media platforms like Facebook messenger or Alexa can be used to connct this project.Chat Bot Uses QnA Maker to create chat bot service for user. From QnA maker portal, we can create and add knowledgebase to the bot. This project uses the information from an already existing website(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html). Information is fetched from this website and reflected in the form of a series of questionnaire in our knowlegebase. Some more customised questions can also be added.This knowlegebase is then saved, trained and tested. Then a web app bot is created and deployed.This web app bot has an embedded code in channels, from where the unique code is fetched and deployed in our website created using Google site. The website is then published and has this coronavirus chatbot to answer most frequently asked questions from the user.So by simply adding chatbot services like these, we can enlighten a large number of people and help them gain more knowlege about this pandemic.
